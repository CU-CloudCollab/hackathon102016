# Release history

## 1.6.0, 26 August 2016

- support for custom authorizers

## 1.5.1, 4 August 2016

- by default, API processing stops the node VM using the [callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-context.html) Lambda context parameter. This is to prevent runaway node.js events caused by third party libs causing the Lambda VM to become stuck after a request completes. If you really want the VM execution to continue until the event loop empties, even after your API process is done, then set `lambdaContext.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` to `true` in your request handler.

## 1.5.0, 12 July 2016

- support for intercepting and modifying requests

## 1.4.1, 1.4.0, 11 July 2016

- shortcut for configuring stage variables during deployment
- you can now provide a handler for unsupported event formats, and invoke the same Lambda from a source that's not API Gateway
